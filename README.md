## SKETCHIN'

Oh hai, thanks for checkin' in. This repo has all them cool sketchnotes (or the ones that turned out nice) that I've been putting together. 

There are currently only [guides](https://github.com/lrlna/sketchin/tree/master/guides) and they will be linked up to their initial sources. You may eventually see conference sketchnotes as well, so be on the lookout ^_^


Hope you enjoy! (((ೕ( ･ㅂ･ )و )))
